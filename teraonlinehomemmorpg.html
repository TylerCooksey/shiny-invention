	<p><b>TERA Online is an MMOPRG game which was released in South Korea on
	on January 25th, 2011, in Japan on August 18th, 2011, in North American
	on May 1st, 2012, and in Europe on May 3rd, 2012, with closed and open
	beta testings taking place before the launch dates.</b></p>
	<p><b>Background too TERA revealed: 
    About a millennia ago two omnipotent titans Arun and Shara entered into 
	formless voids and for reasons we can only guess, fell asleep.
    The titans started to dream. Dream of a world that took form on their 
	backs known as Tera.
    The first beings to call Tera home were twelve godlike beings dreamt up 
	by the titans, but it wasn't long before the gods started fighting.
    As the dream continued new creatures took place called mortals, they 
	were less powerful but far more numerous.
    Arun dreamed of ambitious Elves, clever Humans, honor bound Amani, 
	powerful Giants, scheming Devas, and mischievous Poporis.
    Shara dreamed of sly Sikandari, dark Gulas and Vampires, fierce 
	Wendigos, strange Faeries, and serpentine Nagas.
    The mortals were forced into the divine wars of the gods, which 
	eventually left the gods dead, imprisoned, or otherwise diminished.
    The mortal races didn't escape unscathed. Some-like the Sikandari, 
	and most of the Giants-were wiped out but others rose from the wars 
	such as the Barakas and Castanics.
    Now that the gods were gone the seven races; Amani, Barakas, Castanics, 
	Elin, High Elves, Humans, and Poporis must band together to fend off a 
	new enemy.
    A metallic race from the underworld called Argons; their goal is to take 
	over Tera and wake the titans to end their dreams and destroy Tera.</b></p></div></font>
